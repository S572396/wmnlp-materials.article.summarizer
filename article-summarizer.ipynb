    "#### Question 10. Create a summary of the article by going through every sentence in the article and adding it to an (initially) empty list if its score (based on lemmas) is greater than the cutoff score you identified in question 8.  If your loop variable is named `sent`, you may find it easier to add `sent.text.strip()` to your list of sentences.  Print the summary (I would cleanly generate the summary text by `join`ing the strings in your list together with a space (`' '.join(sentence_list)`)."
